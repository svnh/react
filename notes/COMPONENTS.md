## Components

[Facebook.github.io]: "React thinks of UIs as simple state machines. By thinking of a UI as being in various states and rendering those states, it's easy to keep your UI consistent.

In React, you simply update a component's state, and then render a new UI based on this new state. React takes care of updating the DOM for you in the most efficient way."

Programming in react *is* building reusable components.

Both the view and logic for the view.
